# Glam-ACD
In the **basic** folder, we plotted the skewness-kurtosis admissible region, modes, and hazard function of Glam distributions. 

In the **simulation** folder, we consider two sets of parameter configurations to investigate the finite-sample performance of the maximum likelihood estimation of our proposed ACD models.

In the **application** folder, we applied the newly proposed ACD models to the trading data of six stocks and compared their performance with benchmarks.
